# commentator_overlay

Hello everyone!

This is a mini-project that I've made for commentators of Valorant. You can type the two team names, their players, and the agents they are playing into the website, and receive a nice little display with agent pictures next to the players while you're commentating! There is a switch button that will appear once you have submitted the information for the first time, and when the sides switch at half-time, the colors associated with the teams will switch as well.

You can visit the site at: https://kurahaneko.github.io/commentator_overlay/
